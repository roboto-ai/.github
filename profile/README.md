At [**Roboto**](https://www.roboto.ai) we help teams to search, transform and analyze robotics data. We're entering a golden age for robots and autonomous systems, but the data they produce is growing exponentially and existing platforms lack support for it. Our data platform natively supports multi-modal data and uses AI to quickly traverse it.

ðŸ”® [**Data Platform**](https://app.roboto.ai) â€“ Search, analyze and transform logs from your robots. Includes support for ROS, PX4 and more.

ðŸ’» [**SDK & CLI**](https://github.com/roboto-ai/roboto-python-sdk) â€“ Programmatically interact with Roboto using the Python SDK or CLI. 

ðŸªµ [**Robologs**](https://github.com/roboto-ai/robologs) â€“ An open library of robotics data transforms that can be run locally or at scale in the cloud.

You can get started by creating a free account at [Roboto](https://app.roboto.ai). Read the [docs](https://docs.roboto.ai) and optionally [install](https://github.com/roboto-ai/roboto-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#sign-up) our SDK/CLI:
