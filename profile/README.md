At Roboto, we help engineering teams search, transform and analyze sensor data. The world is entering a golden age of robotics, but the volume of sensor data is exploding and existing platforms lack support for it. We are building a new kind of platform that natively supports multi-modal sensor data and uses AI to quickly traverse it.

ðŸ”® [**Data Engine**](https://roboto.ai) â€“ Store and process sensor data so you can search and analyze it. Includes support for ROS, PX4 and more.

ðŸªµ [**Robologs**](https://github.com/roboto-ai/robologs) â€“ An open library of sensor data transformations that can be run locally or at scale in the cloud.

You can get started by creating a free account at [**Roboto**](https://app.roboto.ai) and optionally install our CLI:

```
pip install roboto
```
