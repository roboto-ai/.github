At Roboto, we help teams to search, transform and analyze robotics data. The world is entering a golden age of robots and autonomous systems, but the data they produce is growing exponentially and existing platforms lack support for it. We are building a new kind of platform that natively supports multi-modal data and uses AI to quickly traverse it.

ðŸ”® [**Data Engine**](https://roboto.ai) â€“ Process log data from your robots to search and analyze it. Includes support for ROS, PX4 and more.

ðŸªµ [**Robologs**](https://github.com/roboto-ai/robologs) â€“ An open library of robotics data transforms that can be run locally or at scale in the cloud.

You can get started by creating a free account at [**Roboto**](https://app.roboto.ai) and optionally install our CLI:

```
pip install roboto
```
